Project Overview

This digital chronometer (stopwatch) is built using the PIC16F84 microcontroller programmed in Microchip assembly language. It solves the PICâ€™s limited I/O pins problem by using 74HC595 shift registers to control four 7-segment displays via a custom serial protocol.

Thanks to carefully crafted delay loops and precise instruction cycle counting, the chronometer maintains high accuracy.

History

I developed this project in 2009 while still a student. It was published in 2011 on the ABC Electronique website, thanks to Mr. Bigonoff, and has since been downloaded nearly 3,000 times.
